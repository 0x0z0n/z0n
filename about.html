    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! üëã I'm a <strong>Cybersecurity Analyst</strong> with hands-on experience in both <strong>offensive and defensive security operations</strong>. I actively contribute to SecOps, helping organizations identify and mitigate threats before they cause harm.</p>

    <p>My core passion lies in <strong>exploit development</strong>‚Äîwhether it's researching vulnerabilities, crafting proof-of-concepts, or understanding the intricacies of low-level systems. I regularly apply my knowledge of <strong>networking</strong>, <strong>programming</strong>, and <strong>vulnerability analysis</strong> to solve complex security challenges.</p>

    <p>With a problem-solving mindset, I focus on building resilient security strategies and improving threat detection, response, and prevention. I also share insights and learning through CTF and bug bounty writeups on this blog.</p>
