# Technical



**NIST Incident Response Lifecycle (4 Phases)**:

1. **Preparation**

* Establish policies, response teams, tools, and training.

&#x20; **2. Detection & Analysis**

* Identify and assess potential incidents using logs, alerts, and reports.

3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**

* Limit damage, remove threats, and restore systems.

4. **Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned)**

* Review what happened, improve processes, and update documentation

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Linking files :** can mean different things depending on your context—whether you're trying to share files, create shortcuts, or reference files in code or systems.
* **Prefetch files** : are special system files created by Windows to speed up application startup times. They act like a shortcut for your operating system, storing data about how and where programs load so that future launches are faster and more efficient.

🚀 What Prefetch Files Do

* When you run an app for the first time, Windows creates a .pf file in the C:\Windows\Prefetch folder.
* This file contains metadata like:
* App name and path
* Run count
* Last execution timestamp
* Resources loaded during launch
* Windows uses this info to optimize disk access and reduce boot time for frequently used apps.

🔍 Forensics & Analysis Prefetch files are useful in digital forensics:

* Reveal which apps were run, when, and how often.
* Help investigators track malware execution or user activity.
* Each .pf file includes a hash of the executable path, making it unique to where the app was launched.

🧼 Can You Delete Them? Yes, but with caveats:

* Safe to delete if you're freeing up space or troubleshooting.
* Windows will recreate them as needed.
* Deleting them may cause apps to load slightly slower the next time. To delete: Win + R → type "prefetch" → Enter → Ctrl + A → Delete

***

## Common Event Types in Application Logs

* Startup and shutdown events for applications
* Crash reports or unhandled exceptions
* License or activation issues
* Database connection failures
* Service start/stop notifications
* Custom application messages (if the app is designed to log them)

***

## <sub>Mimikatz : Extract the sensitive password from windows systems</sub>

**Pass the hash attack** : A Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attack is a cyber technique where an attacker uses a hashed version of a password—rather than the actual password—to authenticate and gain access to systems.

**Lateral movement :**
\
it is Key tactic of advance cybersecurity attack.
\
After initial compromise,it refers how attacker move within network from one system/application/account to another.

* explore internal network
* escalate previelegs
* spread across endpoint applications
* maintain persistent even initial entry point is discovered.

**Common techniques used :**
\
Pass the hash - reuse the password to authenticate
\
Internal phishing

**Privilege escalation:**

It is a cyber security concept where attacker gains unauthorized access to higher level permissions within system/network/application\\

**Types of Privilege escalation:**
\
\* Vertical - elevet higher access
\
\* Horizontal - gains access to other system with same privilege

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Persistent :**&#x49;t refers to techniques and strategies attacker use to maintain ongoing access to compromised system.

### common persistent techniques:&#xD; <sup><sub>Scheduled tasks/cron jobs : re-execute malware at regular intervals<sub></sup>&#xD; <sup><sub>Registry run keys : auto start malware on windows boot<sub></sup>&#xD; <sup><sub>web shells : maintain access via compromised web servers<sub></sup>&#xD; <sup><sub>rootkits :<sub></sup>&#xD; <sup><sub>tocken/session hijacking - reuse stolen credentials<sub></sup>&#xD; <sup><sub>service creation: install malicious services that servive reboots<sub></sup>

# Mitre Attack

# MITRE ATT\&CK

**The MITRE ATT\&CK Framework**—short for *Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge*—is a globally accessible knowledge base that documents how cyber adversaries behave in real-world attacks. It’s like a playbook of hacker moves, used by defenders to anticipate, detect, and respond to threats more effectively.

🎯 Purpose of MITRE ATT\&CK

* **Standardizes threat intelligence** by mapping attacker behavior to known patterns.
* **Improves detection and response** by helping security teams recognize tactics and techniques.
* **Supports red and blue teams** in simulating and defending against realistic attack scenarios.
* **Enables security gap analysis** to identify weaknesses in defenses.
* **Fosters collaboration** with a shared language across cybersecurity teams.

🧩 Structure: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

🔐 Example:

* **Tactic**: Credential Access
* **Technique**: Brute Force
* **Sub-technique**: Password Spraying
* **Procedure**: APT28 using Hydra to automate login attempts

🛠️ How It's Used

🔍 Threat Detection & Hunting

* Map logs and alerts to ATT\&CK techniques to identify suspicious behavior.
* Build behavioral analytics that go beyond signature-based detection.

🧪 Red Teaming & Adversary Emulation

* Simulate known threat actor campaigns using documented TTPs.
* Test defenses against realistic attack paths.

🛡️ Security Operations & SOC Maturity

* Assess coverage across tactics and techniques.
* Prioritize detection engineering and response playbooks.

**Purpose Behind Its Creation**

* **Bridge the gap between threat intelligence and defense**: Traditional security tools relied heavily on static indicators like IP addresses or file hashes, which attackers could easily change. MITRE ATT\&CK introduced a **behavioral approach**, focusing on how adversaries operate rather than what tools they use.
* **Enable proactive defense**: Instead of reacting to known malware, ATT\&CK helps organizations **anticipate attacker moves** and build resilient detection strategies

Real-World Roots

The framework is based on **actual observations** from cyber incidents, threat reports, and analyst research. That’s why it continues to evolve—new techniques are added as attackers adapt

# Microsoft  Sentinel (SIEM)

## Microsoft Sentinel workspace <a href="#module-unit-title" id="module-unit-title"></a>

Before deploying Microsoft Sentinel, it's crucial to understand the workspace options. The Microsoft Sentinel solution is installed in a Log Analytics Workspace, and most implementation considerations are focused on the Log Analytics Workspace creation. The single most important option when creating a new Log Analytics Workspace is the region. The region specifies the location where the log data will reside.

The three implementation options:

* Single-Tenant with a single Microsoft Sentinel Workspace
* Single-Tenant with regional Microsoft Sentinel Workspaces
* Multi-Tenant

### Single-tenant single workspace <a href="#single-tenant-single-workspace" id="single-tenant-single-workspace"></a>

The single-tenant with a single Microsoft Sentinel workspace will be the central repository for logs across all resources within the same tenant.

This workspace receives logs from resources in other regions within the same tenant. Because the log data (when collected) will travel across regions and stored in another region, this creates two possible concerns. First, it can incur a bandwidth cost. Second, if there's a data governance requirement to keep data in a specific region, the single workspace option wouldn't be an implementation option.

<figure><img src="https://2363832561-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FcXy5hq3eo7DEg0EEJn0D%2Fuploads%2Fy5rqE6RjvGJpNJx0aMFq%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=bb4d794e-3215-4dcd-857e-52c984f05bf3" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Single-tenant with regional Microsoft Sentinel workspaces <a href="#single-tenant-with-regional-microsoft-sentinel-workspaces" id="single-tenant-with-regional-microsoft-sentinel-workspaces"></a>

The single-tenant with regional Microsoft Sentinel workspaces will have multiple Sentinel workspaces requiring the creation and configuration of multiple Microsoft Sentinel and Log Analytics workspaces.

<figure><img src="https://2363832561-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FcXy5hq3eo7DEg0EEJn0D%2Fuploads%2FPmE9ZFNVYvHbH79WTqHd%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=3afa2b70-b032-446d-986a-ad17eb8d1eb4" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Multi-tenant workspaces <a href="#multi-tenant-workspaces" id="multi-tenant-workspaces"></a>

If you're required to manage a Microsoft Sentinel workspace, not in your tenant, you implement Multi-Tenant workspaces using Azure Lighthouse. This security configuration grants you access to the tenants. The tenant configuration within the tenant (regional or multi-regional) is the same consideration as before.

<figure><img src="https://2363832561-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FcXy5hq3eo7DEg0EEJn0D%2Fuploads%2F9Vq9lHmTo1XEzHnxynWq%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=07d8c410-52c4-4a24-a040-d7e731c3ba98" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

resource group --> log analytics workspace --> Add Microsoft sentinel&#x20;

### Create and configure a Log Analytics Workspace <a href="#create-and-configure-a-log-analytics-workspace" id="create-and-configure-a-log-analytics-workspace"></a>

1. The next page, **Add Microsoft Sentinel to a workspace** will display a list of available Log Analytics workspaces to add Microsoft Sentinel. Select the **+ create a new workspace** button to start the "Create Log Analytics workspace" process.
2. The Basics tab includes the following options:

   Expand table

   | Option         | Description                                                                                                    |
   | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Subscription   | Select the Subscription                                                                                        |
   | Resource Group | Select or create a Resource Group                                                                              |
   | Name           | Name is the name of the Log Analytics workspace and will also be the name of your Microsoft Sentinel Workspace |
   | Region         | The region is the location the log data is stored.                                                             |

   3.Select the **Review + Create** button and then select the **Create** button.

### Add Microsoft Sentinel to the workspace <a href="#add-microsoft-sentinel-to-the-workspace" id="add-microsoft-sentinel-to-the-workspace"></a>

The "Add Microsoft Sentinel to Workspace" screen will now appear after you've completed the previous steps.

1. Wait for the newly created "Log Analytics Workspace" to appear in the list. This operation could take a few minutes.
2. Select the newly created Log Analytics workspace. And select the **Add** button.

The new Microsoft Sentinel workspace is now the active screen. The Microsoft Sentinel left navigation has four areas:

* General
* Threat management
* Content management
* Configuration

The Overview tab displays a standard dashboard of information about the ingested data, alerts, and incidents.

**To change event retention period:**\
&#x20;            Goto Setting --> Workspace setting --> Tables --> 3 dots(right side ) --> Manage table --> select days in interactive retention like 30-60-90 days.

## Manage workspaces across tenants using Azure Lighthouse <a href="#module-unit-title" id="module-unit-title"></a>

If you're required to manage multiple Microsoft Sentinel workspaces, or workspaces not in your tenant, you have two options:

* Microsoft Sentinel Workspace manager
* Azure Lighthouse

### Microsoft Sentinel Workspace manager <a href="#microsoft-sentinel-workspace-manager" id="microsoft-sentinel-workspace-manager"></a>

Microsoft Sentinel's Workspace manager enables users to centrally manage multiple Microsoft Sentinel workspaces within one or more Azure tenants. The Central workspace (with Workspace manager enabled) can consolidate content items to be published at scale to Member workspaces. Workspace manager is enabled in the `Configuration settings`.

<figure><img src="https://2363832561-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FcXy5hq3eo7DEg0EEJn0D%2Fuploads%2FFqgq35XSUoFS25mvTxrO%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=282252f1-ca88-4bde-b8a5-8350013ac51d" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Azure Lighthouse <a href="#azure-lighthouse" id="azure-lighthouse"></a>

Implementing Azure Lighthouse provides the option to enable your access to the tenant. Once Azure Lighthouse is onboarded, use the directory + subscription selector on the Azure portal to select all the subscriptions containing workspaces you manage.

Azure Lighthouse allows greater flexibility to manage resources for multiple customers without having to sign in to different accounts in different tenants. For example, a service provider may have two customers with different responsibilities and access levels. By using Azure Lighthouse, authorized users can sign in to the service provider's tenant to access these resources

### Microsoft Sentinel-specific roles <a href="#microsoft-sentinel-specific-roles" id="microsoft-sentinel-specific-roles"></a>

All Microsoft Sentinel built-in roles grant read access to the data in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace:

* **Microsoft Sentinel Reader**: can view data, incidents, workbooks, and other Microsoft Sentinel resources.
* **Microsoft Sentinel Responder**: can, in addition to the above, manage incidents (assign, dismiss, etc.)
* **Microsoft Sentinel Contributor**: can, in addition to the above, create and edit workbooks, analytics rules, and other Microsoft Sentinel resources.
* **Microsoft Sentinel Automation Contributor**: allows Microsoft Sentinel to add playbooks to automation rules. It isn't meant for user accounts.

**Giving Microsoft Sentinel permissions to run playbooks**

Microsoft Sentinel uses a **special service account** to run incident-trigger playbooks manually or to call them from automation rules. The use of this account (as opposed to your user account) increases the security level of the service.

In order for an automation rule to run a playbook, this account must be granted explicit permissions to the resource group where the playbook resides. At that point, any automation rule will be able to run any playbook in that resource group. To grant these permissions to this service account, your account must have Owner permissions on the resource groups containing the playbooks.

* **Connecting data sources to Microsoft Sentinel**

  For a user to add data connectors, you must assign the user write permissions on the Microsoft Sentinel workspace. Also, note the required other permissions for each connector, as listed on the relevant connector page.
* **Guest users assigning incidents**

  If a guest user needs to be able to assign incidents, then in addition to the Microsoft Sentinel Responder role, the user will also need to be assigned the role of Directory Reader.

### Microsoft Sentinel roles and allowed actions <a href="#microsoft-sentinel-roles-and-allowed-actions" id="microsoft-sentinel-roles-and-allowed-actions"></a>

The following table summarizes the roles and allowed actions in Microsoft Sentinel.

<figure><img src="https://2363832561-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FcXy5hq3eo7DEg0EEJn0D%2Fuploads%2Fna69Sts1bdmH1YzLsUTX%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=83fd32cc-58fc-46ab-9dde-257e56a062e1" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<kbd>**To exclude certain events from being indexed by Microsoft Sentinel**</kbd><kbd>,</kbd>&#x20;

you can use **ingestion-time filtering** or **Data Collection Rules (DCR)** with the **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)**. Here are the steps for both methods:

#### Ingestion-Time Filtering

1. **Navigate to Settings**: In Microsoft Sentinel, go to the **Settings** section.
2. **Select Data Sources**: Choose the data source you want to configure.
3. **Configure Ingestion-Time Filters**: Set up filters to exclude specific events based on criteria like Event ID, Source, or other attributes.

#### Using Data Collection Rules (DCR) with AMA

1. **Create a Data Collection Rule**: In the **Azure Monitor** section, create a new Data Collection Rule.
2. **Define the Rule**: Specify the criteria for collecting data, including exclusions for certain events.
3. **Deploy the Rule**: Apply the rule to the relevant systems or virtual machines.

#### Example: Excluding Specific Event IDs

If you want to exclude specific event IDs, you can configure the rule to ignore those IDs during data collection. For example, to exclude Event ID 4662 (which is often related to object access), you can set up a filter in the DCR to ignore this ID

## rsyslog / syslog-ng is log forwarding tools which uses syslog protocol


# Rule creation

# Device Onboarding

Steps to collect Logs from Windows VM :

1. Install AMA on VM
2. Create a Data collection Rule that targets Security event Log
3. Assign DCR to your VM
4. Verify Logs in sentinel

**if its Azure windows VM then**

* Go to VM resource from Azure portal
* Under monitoring ,select Extensions + Applications
* Click + add and select AzureMonitorWindowsAgent

**If its Non Azure or on-Prem VM**

* Download Azure ARC script from Azure portal
* Run script on on prem VM so it will listdown in Azure
* then install AMA agent from extensions.

## Ports used for integration:

**For Windows :** \
Win VM —---- 5986-------> Windows event Forwarding(Forwarder) ------> AMA ------443------> Ms Sentinel

VM --> Forwarder = 5986\
Forwarder via AMA --> Sentinel = 443

**For Linux :**\
VM -----514-----> Rsyslog/rsyslog.ng -----28330------> AMA -------443-----> Sentinel

VM ---> Rsyslog = 514\
rsyslog --> AMA = 28330\
AMA --> Sentinel = 443



# Playbook Creation in Sentinel

Playbook

we need to design work flow then define automation rule to execute it

1. Goto sentinel --> Automation --> Playbook
2. Click + Add > Playbook with incident trigger
3. Use Logic app designer to build a workflow
   * Trigger : when incident created or updated
   * Action : Send email , Call API's , update ticket etc.
4. Setup Automation Rule : It controls when and How playbook run
   * Goto Sentinel -> Automation -> Automation Rules
   * Click + Add new rule
     * Condition : Incident severity , status , entity type
     * Actions : Run Playbook , Assign incident , tag incident

\
\-->
\
service to service - real time injection from MS services
\
Agent based - Uses Azure monitor agent (AMA) for syslog / CEF and custom logs
\
API based - rest API or code less connector platform for custom integrations
\
Content Hub solution - Bundled with Dashboard , playbook and analytics rules

**How does sentinel uses Threat intelligence ?**
\
\--> It uses Microsoft defender Threat intelligence or Taxii
\
it provides IOC's - ips , domains , hash

**Analytic rule ?**
\
\--> logic based configuration to trigger alert
\
scheduled Rule - run at regular intervals
\
Microsoft security rule - ingest alerts from other tools
\
fusion rules - use machine learning to detect attack
\
custom rule - build from scratch using KQL

**Aggregation and Normalization :**
\
\--> Aggregation : collecting and consolidating data in one place
\
Normalization : converting collected data into understandable format.

**what is Fusion rules ?**
\
\--> AI driven correlation of multi stage attack across data sources.
\
Fusion is built in machine learning powered correlation engine designed to detect multistage attack.

fusion alerts are rare but highly accurate .

fusion creates high severity incidents.

**What is ASIM (Advance security information model ) - Normalization in sentinel**
\
\--> its Normalization framework
\
transforms vendor specific logs into standardized schema.
\
it acts as Translation layer between raw logs and siem tool.

**how UEBA works ?**
\
user and Entity behavioural analytics is helps to detect insider threats , compromised accounts by analyzing behavioural patterns
\
across user devices ,IP , applications.

**#How service now you will integrate via automation?**\
&#x20;\-->&#x20;

1. Install the Microsoft Sentinel Solution for ServiceNow

* Available via the ServiceNow Store and Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub.
* This app enables bi-directional sync: incidents created in Sentinel appear in ServiceNow, and closing them in ServiceNow updates Sentinel too.

2. Create a Logic App in Azure

* Go to Microsoft Sentinel > Automation > Playbooks.
* Create a new playbook using the ServiceNow connector.
* Use the trigger: “When an incident is created”.

3. Configure the Playbook

* Add actions to:
* Create a new incident in ServiceNow.
* Populate fields like severity, description, and a deep link to the Sentinel incident.
* Optionally, include logic to filter incidents based on severity or tags

## How to investigate scheduled tasks --> Investigate Scheduled Tasks in Windows
